        <h1> Morgan Aiken III</h1>

             <p>I learned introduction concepts to computing, software, hardware, cloud services and programming. The historical points <br>
               were also very informative. The introduction to HTML, CSS, and Java is especially well received. That is because Iâ€™m actively <br>
               teaching myself how to use those tools. I must state here that at one time, I thought that they were applications. But now, I <br>
               know that they are not.</p>
