              <p>My name is Morgan Aiken III. I was born and raised in Orangeburg, South Carolina. I just moved to Seattle, Washington from Guam. <br> 
                 The reason that I was in Guam was for business purposes. While I was there, I did a lot of fishing and hiking. Hiking is one of <br> 
                 my favorite sports since I’m and outdoor person. My hobbies include, hunting, fishing, bowling, basketball, and football. I <br> 
                 played football in High School. It was fun but it wasn’t something that I wanted to do after High School. Therefore, I became <br> 
                 interested in the Information Technology field. I feel that I have a natural talent for the field and that I why I enrolled in <br>
                at Seattle Central College.</p>
